OTT – Over-the-top media is no longer the future of entertainment but is now the reality.​

With over 50% of North Americans maintaining Netflix subscriptions, it’s clear consumers love OTT content. It is the most popular form of entertainment today across all age groups. All that a consumer needs to have is a compatible hardware device enabled with good internet connection​

An “over-the-top” media service is any online content provider that offers streaming media as a standalone product.  An OTT conversation largely revolves around video-on-demand, however, it also supports audio, messaging and VOIP​

Any application or service that provides a product over the internet while bypassing traditional media services is an OTT application​

Popular OTT applications for video streaming are NetFlix, Amazon Video, YouTube, HBO etc.​
