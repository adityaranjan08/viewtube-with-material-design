# ViewTube

### Styling ViewTube application with Angular Material

### Context - ViewTube-Phase 1

OTT – Over-the-top media is no longer the future of entertainment but is now the reality.​

With over 50% of North Americans maintaining Netflix subscriptions, it’s clear consumers love OTT content. It is the most popular form of entertainment today across all age groups. All that a consumer needs to have is a compatible hardware device enabled with good internet connection​

An “over-the-top” media service is any online content provider that offers streaming media as a standalone product.  An OTT conversation largely revolves around video-on-demand, however, it also supports audio, messaging and VOIP​

Any application or service that provides a product over the internet while bypassing traditional media services is an OTT application​

Popular OTT applications for video streaming are NetFlix, Amazon Video, YouTube, HBO etc.​

### Challenge

Seeing the demand of OTT applications, the team at eZone Pvt. Ltd., who are popular in providing software solutions in the field of entertainment, have started with a project to develop an OTT application – ViewTube. ​

To attract good viewership the application should provide rich user experience.​

Google has provided with Material as the language of design that helps to develop applications with high-quality design.​

Hence the team at eZone wants to design UI implementing the principles followed by Material Design.​

The application should attract both the different types of users:​

1. One set of users who are all keen on viewing the videos over this OTT platform.​
2. The second set of users who are interested in creating and publishing their own videos or even schedule live events over this OTT platform.​

### Problem – ViewTube Phase - 1​

In the first phase, to stay ahead in the heavy competitive market, the eZone Pvt. Ltd. wants to release the ViewTube application quickly to market.​

Angular applications can be designed with rich UX quickly by incorporating Angular Material components into it.​

You as a frontend developer has been assigned with the responsibility of quickly get the first version of ViewTube ready.​

In the first version, the landing view of the application should be rendered with video cards with brief description, number of views, duration since it was published and the length of video.​

The application should have header with search box, links with icons and tooltips, and collapsible sidebar with navigation links with icons.​
